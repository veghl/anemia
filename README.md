## MATLAB App for Anemia Types Prediction from CBC Data

This MATLAB app calculates the likelihood of various anemia types from Complete Blood Count (CBC) data using Ensemble and Tree machine learning classification models. 

- To train and test the machine learning classification models, the following dataset was used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehababoelnaga/anemia-types-classification

- To achieve higher accuracy, the dataset was oversampled with the SMOTE algorithm.
